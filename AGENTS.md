# Agent Instructions & Project Context

## Environment Rules
- **OS:** Windows 10/11
- **Terminal Protocol:** Always prefix terminal commands with `cmd /c` to prevent the agent from hanging on execution.
- **Package Management:** Use `npm` (or your preferred manager) and ensure `-y` flags are used for non-interactive installs.
